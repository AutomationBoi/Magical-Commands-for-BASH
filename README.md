Linux terminal commands replaced with harry potter spells

# Install

To use new commands in every terminal and in different terminal sessions type this row into your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc 
```
. PATH_TO_SPELLS_SCRIPT 
```
For example, if I downloaded this project to my home/ folder, the command to put into bashrc would be:
```
. /home/spellcmds/.spells.sh 
```

If you want to run the script in a single terminal session you just have to go to the location where you've downloaded the project and run 
```
. PATH_TO_PROJECT/.spells.sh
```

The same way like above one, if I downloaded the project to my home/ folder, I have to type:
```
. /home/spellcmds/.spells.sh
```

or 

```
. ~/spellcmds/.spells.sh
```

You can use source command as well so:

```
source ~/spellcmds/.spells.sh 
```
